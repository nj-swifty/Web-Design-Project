                The chili pepper is the fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum, members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically
                are capsaicin and several related chemicals, collectively called capsaicinoids. The modern method for quantitative The "heat" of chili peppers is the SHU rating which uses high-performance liquid
                chromatography to directly measure the capsaicinoid content of a chili pepper variety. Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, and crystalline-to-waxy solid at room temperature, and
                measures 16,000,000 SHU.

                Chili peppers originated in the Americas after the Columbian Exchange. They were brought to Asia by Portuguese navigators during the 16th century. About 9.4 million acres of land produce 33 million tons
                of chili peppers. India is the world's biggest producer, consumer and exporter of chili peppers. Chili peppers have been a part of the human diet in the Americas since at least 7500 BCE. The most recent
                research shows that chili peppers were domesticated more than 6000 years ago in Mexico,and were one of the first self-pollinating crops cultivated in Mexico, Central and parts of South America.
                Christopher Columbus was one of the first Europeans to encounter them and called them "peppers" because they, like black and white pepper have a spicy hot taste unlike other foodstuffs.
