            Rocoto Roja
        </h1>

        <p>
            Large, extremely pungent chillies with distinctive black seeds from the Peruvian Andes. They are sometimes known as Manzano, or 'apple' because of their shape. Rocotos can be more difficult to germinate
            than other chillies, but are remarkably cold-tolerant once they get going.
        </p>

        <p>
            They have a very distinctive hairy foliage and are quite large plants. There are numerous varieties of Rocotos, these are quite large fruited red chillies that are amongst the world's hottest chillies.
