            <h2>
                Help You Burn Fat and Lose Weight:
            </h2>

            <p>
                Capsaicin is a thermogenic. Thermogenics stimulate the body's burning of fat by increasing the metabolism of the body's adipose tissue, generating heat.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Fight Headaches and Inflammation:
            </h2>

            <p>
                Capsaicin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent. It inhibits Substance P, which is associated with inflammatory processes relieving headaches and migraines. Capsaicin may also one day be a treatment
                for arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic neuropathy.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Help Lower High Blood Pressure:
            </h2>

            <p>
                Eating chili peppers are naturally high in vitamins A and C, and also bioflavinoids. They help strengthen our blood vessels, which makes them more elastic and better able to adjust to blood pressure
                fluctuations. Chili peppers also can make us sweat, which causes fluid loss, temporarily reducing overall blood volume.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Fight Cancer:
            </h2>

            <p>
                According to the research, capsaicin induced approximately 80 percent of prostate cancer cells growing in mice. Prostate cancer tumors treated with capsaicin were about one-fifth the size of tumors
                in non-treated mice.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Prevent Sinusitis and Relieve Congestion:

            </h2>

            <p>
                The pepper heat helps to stimulate secretions that aid in clearing mucus from your nose, combatting nasal congestion. It also contains antibacterial properties that help fight chronic sinus infections.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Stomach Irritation:
            </h4>

            <p>
                Extremely hot ones can burn the inside of the mouth and can also be irritating when excreted. A glass of milk or yogurt helps keeping the capsaicin away from nerve-receptor sites to
                ease the burning sensation.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Skin Irritation:
            </h4>

            <p>
                Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose, mouth or other sensitive parts of your body after handling chilies. The capsaicin will stick to your fingers and hands and burn very badly. Make sure to wash
                your hands many times after touching chilies.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Toxic:
            </h4>

            <p>
                High concentration of capsaicin (very spicy chillies and in excess) can be painful as to be incapacitating as it can block the production of certain neurotransmitters, preventing nerves from communicating
                with each other.
