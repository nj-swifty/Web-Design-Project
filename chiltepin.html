            Chiltepin
        </h1>

        <p>
            The mother of all chillies; the original and some say still the best. Chiltepin is the earliest recorded chilli and it still grows wild around the deserts of Texas and New Mexico. Plants can grow
            quite large and later in the season become covered with small, round and highly explosive little pods.
        </p>

        <p>
            This chilli was used as a tax payment, paid to Aztec emperors.
