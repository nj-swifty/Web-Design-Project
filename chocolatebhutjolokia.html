            Chocolate Bhut Jolokia
        </h1>

        <p>
            This is a natural variant of the Bhut Jolokia that comes in a gorgeous deep chocolatey colour. No, it doesn't taste anything like the sweet snack but has a fresh flavour with a serious kick to it!
            Pods ripen from lime green to a gorgeous rich chocolate colour. The plant seems to produce marginally less pods than its red counterpart but some exceptionally large pods. Pods are extreme but not
            quite as hot as the red variant.
