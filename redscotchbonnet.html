            Red Scotch Bonnet
        </h1>

        <p>
            A popular chinense type chilli with all the hallmarks of a classic pod; it is extremely hot, around 325,000 SHU with a distinctive robust, fruity flavour. Put it inside a roast chicken, pop it is a stew,
            mash it into a sauce or purree, you can't go wrong! Scotch bonnet peppers are very similar to Habanero peppers in both appearance and heat.
        </p>

        <p>
            They originate in the Caribbean, taking their name from their resemblance to the hats Scottish men wear, rather than their place of origin. Scotch Bonnets are now readily available in the shops, but try
            one fresh off the plant and see the difference in taste!
