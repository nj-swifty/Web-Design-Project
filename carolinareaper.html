        <h1>
            Carolina Reaper
        </h1>

        <p>
            Current holder of the Guinness Book of Records title for World's Hottest Chilli. As of December 2013, the Carolina Reaper is officially the hottest. Bred by Ed Currie of the Pukkerbutt Pepper Company in South
            Carolina, the Reaper is reputedly a cross between a Pakastani Naga and a Red Habanero from the Caribbean island of St Vincent. It has a nice fruity flavour coupled with insane heat levels.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Reaper looks mean and it definitely bites! It resembles like a Moruga with the tail of a Scorpion. The chilli has been recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as reaching a heat rating of 1,569,300 SHU.
            You'll find that one pod goes quite a long way! Be careful â€¦.
